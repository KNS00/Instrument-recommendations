# Fine-tuning Recommender Systems on the Amazon Musical Instruments Dataset

This repository contains the report for my project on building and fine-tuning web recommender systems using the [Musical Instruments dataset from the Amazon Review data 2023](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/data_processing/5core.html). 

# Code Structure
The notebooks contain code for the following parts:

* Initialization: pre-processing of data
* CF.ipynb: fine-tuning the CF models
* NLP: text processing and building the Word2Vec content based recommender system
* Hybrid: building the parallel hybrid and the LLM-content-based system.
