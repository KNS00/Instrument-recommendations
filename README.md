# Recommender Systems based on the Amazon Musical Instruments Dataset

This repository contains the report for my project on building and fine-tuning recommender systems using the [Musical Instruments dataset from the Amazon Review data 2023](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/data_processing/5core.html). 

The [slides](https://github.com/KNS00/Instrument-recommendations/blob/main/presentation_readable.pdf) provide an overview of what was developed in the project.

# Code Structure
The notebooks contain code for the following parts:

* Initialization: pre-processing of data.
* CF: fine-tuning and evaluation of collaborative filtering models.
* NLP: text processing and building the Word2Vec content based recommender system.
* Hybrid: building the parallel hybrid and the Llama-3.2-1B content-based system.
